The Pickled Cartographer
========================

Identify island maps in Sea of Thieves using a second device!


In Sea of Thieves you can retrieve in-game treasure maps that describe only the shape of the island and the location of treasure. Players are expected to use their shipboard maps to identify these islands. The Pickled Cartographer uses WebRTC and some rudimentary computer vision techniques to identify treasure maps in Sea of Thieves. Since this relies on camera input data, the application was designed with Mobile Safari in mind.
